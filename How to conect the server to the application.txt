Setting up connection between the application and SQL database server

1- Create database StudyRoomBooking and Add some users to table (I sent the files with the queries) 
	
	
2- Create a new login on Microsoft sql server management Studio: 
	Security -> logins (right click on login)
	New Login ( login name: project3300)
	Click SQL Server authentication
	Password: csiis3300
	On the left side click User Mapping and make sure the SudentRoomBooking is selected
	Click ok.

 3-Right click on the StudentRoomBooking database and go to properties.
	On the left side, click Permissions.
	Under User Roles, click project3300
	Under Permissions for 3300, grant the necessary permissions that we will need to
	 access and modify the database(I selected all the options, but I'm sure that's not necessary).
	Click ok

4 - Connect to the login and check if you can access the info on the database StudyRoomBooking
	If you can't connect, check if the SQL Server and Windows Authentication mode is enabled.
		On Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio:
		Right click on the current server -> Properties -> Security 

4 - Run the aplication and login with the username and id saved on database.
